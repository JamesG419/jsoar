Acknowledgements / History
JSoar was originally envisioned and implemented by Dave Ray (and indeed, the 
vast majority of the code is still Dave's). JSoar started out on googlecode in
svn, was converted to mercurial and then git, and then moved to Dave's github 
site, https://github.com/daveray/. Today JSoar is primarily maintained by Soar 
Technology, Inc.
