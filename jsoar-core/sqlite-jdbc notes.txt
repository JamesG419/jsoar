NOTICE:

The sqlite-jdbc has a backup and restore command each of which are intercepted by the driver.  This means
that you cannot prepare the statements like normal sql statements and there is a bit of a hack in
EpisodicMemoryDatabase.java and SemanticMemoryDatabase.java : backupDb to account for this.  There is also
some special handling in AbstractSoarDatabase to account for this as well.  Furthermore, the sqlite-jdbc
jar had to be modified for OS X.  In it there is some native libraries for sqlite with the extension jnilib,
OS X can either use jnilib or dylib for java native libraries and on some machines this is an issue and so
we modified it by copying the jnilib and renaming the copy with a dylib extension this means there is two
dynamic libraries on OS X per architecture.
