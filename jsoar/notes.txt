rete.cpp

* Dropped code relating to NULL_ACTIVATION_STATS, SHARING_FACTORS, and 
TOKEN_SHARING_STATS. It appeared that, when enabled, these wouldn't 
compile in C anymore anyway. Bob M. didn't know what they were for.

* Dropped activation_entry_sanity_check(). It did nothing.

* print_assertion() and print_retraction() are never used in rete.cpp 
(only consistency.cpp). Deferring until needed.

* any_i_assertions_or_retractions_ready() is never used anywhere. Dropped.
* any_assertions_or_retractions_ready() does not use rete structures. Revisit 
  when we figure out where it should go, probably agent. 
* get_next_assertion() does not use rete structures. Revisit 
  when we figure out where it should go, probably agent.
* get_next_retraction() does not use rete structures. Revisit 
  when we figure out where it should go, probably agent.
* get_next_nil_goal_retraction() does not use rete structures. Revisit 
  when we figure out where it should go, probably agent.
* 
* put operand2_mode flag in Rete class since I'd like to keep this decoupled from the agent.
* put nil_goal_retractions list in Rete class for decoupling from Agent.
