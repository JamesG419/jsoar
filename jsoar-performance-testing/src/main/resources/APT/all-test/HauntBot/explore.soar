# Explore should explore any unvisited territory 
# first, and then randomly select new areas to 
# move to (ie, wander). 
#
# Preference is given first to unexplored nodes 
# in the current area, then areas that have 
# unexplored nodes.  
#
# Once everything has been visited, the agent
# should randomly select an adjacent are to move
# to.  It will backtrack only as a last resort.

# Exploration has been modified. Once an agent has visited
# everything, new areas will be selected based upon the 
# number of times they have been visited, stored by 
# each area's 'visit' count. This simple method will
# force the agent to move throughout the entire house.
# This is especially useful for agents that are starting
# with a pre-explored map and still need to look for
# objects.
