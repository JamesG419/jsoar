#+===================+
#| Things to discuss |
#+===================+
#1. Format for productions including comments, tabs, variable names, and production names
#2. Adjusting agent's speed as he approaches doorway nodes.  I think this will both add
#   realism AND prevent the agent from getting stuck much of the time. :AMN:


#+============================+
#| Useful UT Console Commands |
#+============================+
##1. summon Hauntgame.soarHauntbot - summons a soar agent into Infiltration
##2. invisible 1 - makes you invisible
##3. invisible 0 - makes you visible again
##4. god - makes you invincible
##5. ghost - makes your ethereal (can walk through walls and fly)
##6. walk - turns off ghost
##7. F1 - F5: summon TCL Hauntbots 1-5

#+============+
#| Soar To Do |
#+============+
#1. Change map window offset so scrolling is unnecessary
#2. Have map display bots current destination area on the map
#3. Remove requirement that offensive bot have ^map


#+====================+
#| UnrealScript To Do |
#+====================+
#hauntScript Side
#1. Make sure enemies are are actor team
#2. Make sure friendlies are on same team
#3. Should rename .enemy to .entity
#4. The nodes at the end of hall7 leading to Outside should be door nodes not pathnodes
