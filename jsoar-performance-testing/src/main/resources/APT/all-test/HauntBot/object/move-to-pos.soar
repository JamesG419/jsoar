# 
# This is a high-level movement operator that combines move-to-area and move-to-xyz,
# allowing an easy command to move to ANY location in the house
#
# It works as follows, skipping any unnecessary steps
# 
#  1) Move to correct area
#  2) Move to correct x-y-z position
#
# ASSUMPTIONS: This suboperator expects ^position and ^area attributes, 
#              which both describe the target location.
