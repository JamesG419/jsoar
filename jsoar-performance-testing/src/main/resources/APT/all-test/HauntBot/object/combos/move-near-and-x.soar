echo "\nLoading move-near-and-x"

#
# compound command that moves to a specific distance from the target object, faces the object,
# and then executes a secondary action, such as 'grab-object'. The distance is specified
# in "elaborations/parameters.soar" as min-grab-distance and max-grab-distance. 
# Due to the slight inaccuracy in the native Unreal function MoveTo, only an 
# approximate location can be moved to (approximately  +- 15 units, I'm still verifying
# the exact value -MJP 6/3/03)
#
#
# required attributes
#            ^target  (the item to be moved near)
#            ^next-action
#                  ^name
#                  ^type
#                  ^(OPTIONAL)     --> any other attributes for the next action
