#       This file indicates what messages of message-type should be
#       voiced by the agent. This should just be a lookup table.  Eventually,
#       we probably will want to make a distinction between messages sent to
#       the agent communication pane and messages with actual recordings.
#       This will be trivial to do -- all we have to do is create two
#       classes of things of type voice (whereas now there is only the 
#       single name: haunt-interface)
