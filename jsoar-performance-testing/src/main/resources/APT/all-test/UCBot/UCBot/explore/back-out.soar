# This is a debugging rule.  When exploring the map the XML file specifying the connectivity
# of the SSPS regions can contain bad information such as regions being completely unconnected
# from any other region.  It is sometimes possible to enter a region from a connected region
# only to find that the agent has no way out.  Therefore, this rule tests to see if the current
# region has no paths recorded and then simply moves in reverse (hopefully, leaving the current
# region; it doesn't attempt to do anything more intelligent than reverse thrusting).
