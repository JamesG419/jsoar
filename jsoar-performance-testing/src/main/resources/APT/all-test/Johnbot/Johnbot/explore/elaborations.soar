#echo "\nLoading explore/elaborations"

## Elaborate every substate in explore with the room currently being explored: explore-room
##   explore-room is not always the same as current-room, which is the room the bot is in.
##   sometimes while exploring a room, the bot with move into another room.  When that happens, 
##   current-room changes, but explore-room does not - Thus, explore-room maintains a memory of
##   which room the bot should be in.  It is updated in common/goto-next-door/exit-room
