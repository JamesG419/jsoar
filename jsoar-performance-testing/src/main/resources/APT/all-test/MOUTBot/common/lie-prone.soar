# Encode all the situations in which an agent should go to a prone position

# Change history:

#  [1] REW: 2003-05-01
#      General strategy is to only terminate these operators when
#      the position has changed.  Position needs to be input, but for
#      now we track it via ^self
#  [2] REW: 2003-05-01
#      Notional proposals for now (just testing)


# We can always assume that the agent starts in a body position
# other than prone
