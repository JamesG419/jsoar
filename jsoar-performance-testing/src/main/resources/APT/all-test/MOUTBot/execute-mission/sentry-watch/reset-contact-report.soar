# Delete contact reports when no more enemy are visible
#
# Not a complete solution but addresses the problem of one ememy appearing and then disappearing and then 
# another enememy appearing and not being reported.  Likely, since names are available, we should just 
# not report enemies with the same name in the same quadrant,range but that's a lot of information to 
# track.  This will due until we decide more precise reporting is necessary.
