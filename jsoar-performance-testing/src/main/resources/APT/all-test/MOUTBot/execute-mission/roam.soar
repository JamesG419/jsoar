##
# Defines roam behavior for the agent.
#
# The roam mission involves traveling among a series of areas 
# (using goto-next-location). When the bot gets to an area,
# it looks at all of the doors, windows, and connections (search-area)
# and then decides to go to the next area (update-next-area).
# This cycle continues. 
# To specify a roam mission, the objective should have the following structure:
#   (<obj> ^status active
#          ^type roam 
#          ^current-roam-area <r1>  # points to the first in a cycle of areas
#          ^threat <threat>
#          ^defensive-position <dp>  
#          ^team <team3>)
#   (<r1> ^area-name room5         # the first of the areas
#         ^next <r2>)
#   (<r2> ^area-name |EastHall|
#         ^next <r3>)
#   (<r3> ^area-name room4
#         ^next <r1>)
# During execution, current-roam-area will point to the different areas.
# An elaboration in elaborations/mission.soar will add the ^area to 
#  each of the roam-area structures based on the area-name.
# Issues:
#   1. It should walk, not run between areas
#   2. When it searches an area, it is a bit funky in terms of the order
#      it looks at entrances.
#   3. There is nothing in it to decide to go to a defensive position
#      if an attack happens - but that defensive position is defined so...
