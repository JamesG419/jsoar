List of things todo:

- Export results to one or more csv files that can be imported into Excel (Bob to figure out what format should be)
- Add to jsoar build process so can run outside eclipse (see jsoar-build/build.xml)
- Get highwater memory mark
- Run each test in a fresh JVM? (Determine if this will make any difference)
- Consider ability to specify seed per test (in addition to existing global seed -- overrides global if present)
