#
# combos allow multiple actions to be chained together. They are of the following format
#
#  [primary-action]-and-[secondary-action]
#
#  Once the primary action has been completed, the action specifed by the ^name and ^type sub-attributes of
#  ^next-action will be proposed.
#
#  EXAMPLE:
#                   ^next-action
#                          ^name drop-food
#                          ^type drop-object
