## runaway operator 
##   Determine-runaway-door
##   Mark objective abandon
##   Options:
##     Create new objective to defend room that you are going into
##     Go to room furthest from enemy
##   Record time-abandoned

##   REW: 2002-07-10
##        Added ^condition to express the reason that the runaway was proposed (eg, wounded, out of ammo, etc.)
##        Added new application prods that test ^condition and generate an appropriate communication
