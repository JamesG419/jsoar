# This file provides the definition of the information necessary for
# each message.  This file should be generated automatically from a
# more maintainable format (eg, a spreadsheet).

# Note: variabilizing all the content attribute names and then copying
# them to the attributes in the defintion (rather than just re-typing)
# is probably unnecessary.  Certainly, with the automated creation of
# these productions, this variabilization would not be necessary.

# Note: These should likely be located under the communicate operator as they are functionally related to the operator. 
# But Visual Soar does not like them there (no production error checking) so they are here in this directory, which I
# assume is going to get messy fast....
