# Suspend the watch.  Specifies the conditions under which the 
# watch should be suspended. Suspension involves changing the 
# status of the objective.status to suspended which will cause
# sentry-watch to be retracted (active-objective changes)

#      This file is deprecated but I don't yet want to delete it.
#      The threat-level comes from record-threat and now record=threat
#      does not interrupt sentry-watch, so these productions should
#      never fire.
