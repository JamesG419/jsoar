# - Must be able to terminate operator if ammo never changes. Added
#   condition for recognizing reload failures.

# JEL: 2002-12-6
# Moved to execute-mission so always available

# REW: 2003-01-24
# Something's rotten here .... this says reload should
# be proposed anytime there's a clip available, which is
# silly.  Added -^rounds-available.
