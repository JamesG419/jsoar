# Explore should explore any unvisited territory 
# first, and then randomly select new areas to 
# move to (ie, wander).  
#
# Preference is given first to unexplored nodes 
# in the current area, then areas that have 
# unexplored nodes.

# Once everything has been visited, the agent
# should randomly select an adjacent are to move
# to.  It will backtrack only as a last resort.
