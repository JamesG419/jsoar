Building jsoar (as of 8/21/2017)

Building an uber jar:
* in jsoar-build, from the command line run:
    mvn clean install assembly:single

Building individual jars:
* in the repo root, from the command line run:
    mvn clean install
    
Note if you want to use jsoar with an uber jar and Tcl support, you actually need to do both of these, as you'll need the jsoar-tcl jar outside of the uber jar (even though it's in the uber jar, apparently jsoar can't load it from there).
